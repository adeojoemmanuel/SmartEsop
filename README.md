# Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) Smart Contract

This repository contains a Solidity smart contract for managing an Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Smart Contract Overview

The `EmployeeStockOptionPlan.sol` file contains the implementation of the `EmployeeStockOptionPlan` smart contract. It allows a company to grant stock options to employees, define vesting schedules, enable employees to exercise their vested options, and track vested and exercised options.

## Requirements

- Solidity compiler (version 0.8.0 or higher)
- Ethereum development environment (e.g., Remix, Truffle, Hardhat)
- An Ethereum network or local blockchain for deployment and testing

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/employee-stock-option-plan.git
cd employee-stock-option-plan

2. Install dependencies (if any) and set up your Ethereum development environment.

3. Open the `EmployeeStockOptionPlan.sol` file in your preferred development environment.

4. Compile the smart contract using the Solidity compiler.

## Deployment

1. Deploy the `EmployeeStockOptionPlan` contract to an Ethereum network or local blockchain using your chosen development environment.

2. Take note of the deployed contract address, as it will be needed for interacting with the smart contract.

## Usage

The following sections provide examples of how to interact with the `EmployeeStockOptionPlan` smart contract using the provided functions.

### Grant Stock Options

To grant stock options to an employee, call the `grantStockOptions` function with the employee's address and the number of options:

```solidity
function grantStockOptions(address employee, uint256 options) external onlyOwner
```

### Set Vesting Schedule

To set the vesting schedule for an employee's options, call the setVestingSchedule function with the employee's address, total options, vesting duration, cliff duration, and transferability:

function setVestingSchedule(
    address employee,
    uint256 totalOptions,
    uint256 vestingDuration,
    uint256 cliffDuration,
    bool transferable
) external onlyOwner


### Exercise Options
To exercise vested options, call the exerciseOptions function with the number of options to be exercised:

```
function exerciseOptions(uint256 options) external onlyEmployee
```

### Tracking Vested and Exercised Options

To retrieve the number of vested or exercised options for an employee, use the following functions:

```
function getVestedOptions(address employee) public view returns (uint256)
function getExercisedOptions(address employee) public view returns (uint256)

```

### Transfer Options
To transfer vested options to another eligible employee, call the transferOptions function wit

```
function transferOptions(address to, uint256 options) external onlyEmployee
```

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that only the contract owner can grant stock options and set vesting schedules by using the onlyOwner modifier.
- Protect against unauthorized access by using the onlyEmployee modifier for functions that can only be called by eligible employees.
- Validate inputs to prevent invalid values and potential security vulnerabilities.
- Implement appropriate access control mechanisms to protect sensitive functions and data.
- Consider additional security measures like input validation, protection against reentrancy, and safeguarding against overflow/underflow.
